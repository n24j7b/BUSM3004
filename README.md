The Project 
This project is in three parts:1.    Literature-based appraisal, within the context of this   Brief, of the current and future 
opportunity and development needs for businesses in the Cumberland City LGA and Greater Western Sydney (GWS) 
You are required to conduct a review of relevant literature to provide a considered and reliable account of SME business environment and town centre needs in GWS, both now and into the future. This should be conducted with particular relevance to Cumberland City Council. Ideally, your review   should contemplate current and future opportunities; practices; product trends; trading trends; cultural and generational impact; and the impact of new or disruptive players.
2.    Localised research 
To conduct your research, each project team of students will successfully complete 10 interviews with businesses located within a specified research area in the Cumberland City local government area. These areas will be identified through maps or lists provided by the Council client.  Students must conduct their research only within the allocated boundary.  The research is to: 
a.  To provide a synopsis of the practices, nature and characteristics of the SME businesses who occupy your allocated area within the Cumberland LGA.
b.  Your  interviews  with  the   businesses  should  enable  you  to   provide  clear  and  complete responses to each of your developed questions (see page 3) and this data will be used as your data to answer the objectives of the research.  To undertake these interviews, students will be required to engage with business representatives in an appropriate conversational-style. interview process.
3.    Initiatives to support local business The analysis of the data collected through the initial literature review and the interview responses are to result in the development of a considered and comprehensive response to the objectives listed in the client brief (see above).
The final report requires the teams to make recommendations (2 or 3) as to what initiatives and investment could be made by Cumberland City Council either through it’s own funded initiatives of using the support of the state and federal gover代 写BUSM3004 Town Centre Audits SCC Term 2 2024R
